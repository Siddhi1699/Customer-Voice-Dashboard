Organizations receive large volumes of customer feedback from multiple channels, but lack an integrated system to analyze sentiment, identify recurring issues, and monitor trends over time. This project aims to build a Customer Voice Dashboard that consolidates structured data (sales, product info) with unstructured text data (feedback) to deliver actionable insights using Excel, SQL, Power BI, and NLP techniques.
